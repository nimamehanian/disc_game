# Cloverleaf React Challenge

## LIVE DEMO AT [HTTPS://CLOVERDISC.WEB.APP](HTTPS://CLOVERDISC.WEB.APP)

Welcome to the Cloverleaf coding challenge!

Your task is to build a React application that allows a user to take the DISC behavioral assessment.
Feel free to use any supplementary libraries/frameworks.

### About DISC
DISC is an assessment that analyzes your personality based on four traits: Decisiveness, Interactivity, Steadiness, and Conscientiousness.

Descriptive words are grouped into sets of four. Review the words in each set and indicate which word in each set is most like you and least like you.

### Requirements
1. Each set of words must have a Most and Least word selected. (grouped words are in [words.json](./words.json))
2. Only one word in each group may be Most, and only one may be Least.
3. POST answers to `/disc/evaluate` (documentation below).
4. Successful request will return results with a 200 response.
5. Display the user's score. Only render the `total` value for each trait (not the `motivated` or `latent` values).
